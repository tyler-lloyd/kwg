	and configuring peers on the server. The wg server will act as a subnet router to the rest
	of the cluster so peers can access pods and services directly without exposing a public endpoint.
	The only public piece is the WireGuard LoadBalancer service which allows UDP traffic on port 51820
	but any traffic not coming from a valid peer will be dropped.`,
